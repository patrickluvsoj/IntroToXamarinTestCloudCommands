# Intro to Xamarin Test Cloud Commands

This guide is an introduction the commands you will use and see with Xamarin Test Cloud.
The framework we will be exploring is called UITest -- written in the language of C#

You will see these commands in both Xamarin Test Recorder and in the REPL

This guide is meant as an explaination at first but also a cheat sheet that you can refer back to.
We will discuss the most commonly used commands.

This article that you are reading will introduce commands as they come up within your Test Project â€” but if you just want to see a list of the most common commands you can look at this other [cheat sheet.](https://github.com/andrewchungxam/XamarinTestCloudReference)

COMMON COMMANDS - CHEAT SHEET:
<li>app.Tap("button1"); 
<li>app.EnterText (x => x.Id ("edit_phone"), "5555555555");</li>
<li>app.PressEnter();
<li>app.DismissKeyboard ();</li>
<li>app.WaitForElement("button2");
<li>app.Screenshot ("User enters phone number");</li>
</ul>                                                                    
<br />  
 
DEFINITION OF COMMON COMMANDS:

Definitions of the Commands Seen in Test Recorder:
1. app.Tap("button1"); 
* app.Tap("button1") is the most common guesture you'll use.  It mimics a user's tap on the app.  The "button1" represent a button marked with a "button1" id or label.
2. app.EnterText (x => x.Id ("edit_phone"), "Type this");</li>
* Use this command to enter text.  In the above command - the keyboard will type out "Type this" into a UIElement with the ID "edit_phone"
3. app.PressEnter();
* this is one way to submit the text you typed with EnterText - however, in some cases, you may want to dismiss the keyboard and press a Submit button 
4. app.DismissKeyboard();
* this is how you dismiss your keyboard after you enter text
5. app.WaitForElement("button2")
* this is how you get your test to wait for a particular element for up to 90 seconds.  This is really important when your app needs to do a lot of web requests or if the app takes some time to process your requests.  Rather than failing if the element doesn't appear right away, it will wait up to 90 seconds for the element to appear.  This is important when doing your local tests but even more important when you're doing your tests on the Xamarin Test Cloud.
6. app.Screenshot("User enters phone number")
* this is how you tell your application to take a screenshot -- in the Xamarin Test Cloud UI, each step will be denoted by the text you write in this method.  In the above case, it will be "User enters phone number" -- and the Xamarin Test Cloud web page will show a screenshot of your application.

# Understanding the syntax of the commands

In the cheat sheet - you've seen this command or commands similar to it:
* app.Tap("button1"); 

However, when you look at the code generated by Xamarin Test Recorder - you'll likely see that this code written like this:
* app.Tap(x=>x.Marked("button1"));

Both commands will do exactly the same thing!  However, the second command is the long-hand way to fully write out the command.  
<br/>
In both cases, the command is looking for any UI elements with an "Id", "label", or "text" that is reads exactly "button1".  Id is how items are referenced in iOS and lable is how things are referenced in Android.  Both iOS and Android will reference Text for the displayed Text.

In general - you should prefer to link your tests to an "Id" or a "label" over "text" - the reason is that the "text" can easily change as the marketing or business requirements or even language requirements can necessitate frequent changing of the text.

For more about the general C# syntax of this => notation - take a look at this [post](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/274022/how-do-i-pronounce-as-used-in-lambda-expressions-in-net).

---------------------------
# Why do I so often see x=>x.Class("something") and why do I sometime even see a .Index(3) after it?

When you look at the commands that Test Recorder gives back to you -- it will often show up as app.Tap(x=>x.Marked("button1")).  This is the most straightforward output type that you'll see in Test Recorder.

However, sometimes the commands cannot be simplied into the above "straightforward" style.  This is the case when the Id or label fields are not clearly marked.  

:star: ``` Why would Id/label not be clearly marked?  It is actually up to the developer of the iOS or Android application itself, who can set the Id or label of the different controls when they are developing the app.  Setting the Id/label increases the robustness and simplicity of the tests and so we advocate a close collaboration between the QA team and application developers.) ```

So in the case when the Id or label fields are not clear -- then Test Recorder will start chaining Classes and Indexes so you'll see something like this:
app.Tap(x=>x.Class("UITextField").Index(0));

So to translate that; it is looking through all of the elements of the UI, and then making a list of all the elements with Class("UITextField") and then in that list, it is finding the element marked Index(0).

---------
**What do you mean by Class?** 

Everthing you see on the screen of an app is of a class with specific behaviors.  You intuitively know that a Button, a Listview, a Label, and Text Entry Field have different properties and features and behaviors.  What you may not have known is that these are all different considered "classes" and that they are officially refered to by specific names.  For example, in iOS that same list of classes is called UIButton, UITableView, UILabel, and UITextView.   All those behaviors were programmed by the framework designers (on iOS or Android) and then specifically modified by the programmers on your team to give your app it's unique UI and set of behaviors.  


---------
**What do you mean by Index(0)?**

Simply put Index(0) is the first element in the group of elements.

So in this group of elements:
''[0 55 33 22 44]''

Index(0) of the above would be 0.  Index(1) would be 55.  Index(2) would be 33.

So to recap - would you see something like this:
app.Tap(x=>x.Class("UIView").Index(3));

It is looking for all the UI elements of the class "UIView" -- and then please show me the 4th item of that list of elements.  (Remember counting starts at 0 for Index() ).

# Why are there two versions of very similar commands?
For example, there is app.ScrollDown() and there is app.ScrollDownTo("my_element")

Specificity and speed.  

EXAMPLE 1
So let's compare app.ScrollDown() vs. app.ScrollDownTo("something")

If you just type app.ScrollDown() - it's easier to type out but it will only always scroll down a certain fixed amount down.  You really don't have much control besides knowing it will will generally mimic a person scrolling down on a page.

However, if you write app.ScrollDownTo("my_element") then it will scroll down until it finds the item which you specify in quotes.  In this case it will scroll down to a UI element labeled "my_element".

EXAMPLE 2 !!!! IMPORTANT !!!!
Also there is app.ScrollDownTo("my_element") but also app.ScrollDownTo("my_element", "linear_layout")  
In this case, both commands do the same thing -- but the second commands has a second input.  That second input says where to look for the ScrollDownTo.  This makes it more SPECIFIC and it will also make the command run faster because you're actually helping the test runner know where to look for the item.  So you added more SPECIFICITY and SPEED.  

This particular example is important because something tests will fail because they take too long and if the test can't find the element -- it may (incorrectly) think it's because that element just doesn't exist.  So I recommend adding this particular type of specificity to your tests.



This comes down to specificity of what you're looking to do and speed by which you want this command to be executed.

# App.ClearText() -> Why do we need this?

App.ClearText() will empty out a text field so that when you are going to write out text you know you're writing in a fully cleared out text field. 

You don't need to do this everytime you write tests.  So should you include this?  Sometimes tests will go back and forth through screens and to fields that have been filled out or previously or partially filled out.

Rather than keeping track of exactly what has been typed out in previous steps - it is better that we just get the screen on the app to an understood starting state.  So we use app.ClearText() to clear any text in a text field.  This isn't used all the time but if your test does back and forth through screens and re-types data into fields, this is a good practice!

# What are common errors or gotcha's to look out for?
Remember this is a UI test -- and you've got to factor in the speed of your app in writing the tests.  There is some give in all of these commands but if your app is moving slower than the test is executing then your test will fail in situations where it shouldn't.  

Here's what to watch out for:  
-heavy data processing
-web requests that can take a long time-
-keyboarding popping up and hiding buttons or other fields)
Here's how to fix it:

app.WaitForElement(x => x.Marked("logoutButton")); <br />
Thread.Sleep (3000);   //this would be 3 seconds  <br />

# Common REPL : Tree / FLASH / Query 
The REPL is the interactive window that lets you see what UI elements are displaying on the mobile app's screen and it also lets you interact with those elements directly.

In general, the commands are the same that you would either write yourself in Xamarin Studio or Visual Studio and they are also the same that would show up when you use Xamarin Test Recorder.

If you want a list of common commands - you can click [here:] <https://github.com/andrewchungxam/XamarinTestCloudReference/blob/master/README.md>  

The general workflow would look like this.  Launch REPL from Xamarin Test Recorder or you can write this directly in your tests in Xamarin Test Cloud like this:

```
[Test]
public void LaunchRepl()
{
 app.Repl();
}
```

NOTE!  Remember - app.Repl() is great for running local tests and writing out the tests.  When you are ready to actually run the tests in the cloud (on our Xamarin Test Cloud servers with actual devices) - you don't want to run this app.Repl() command.  So what you would do is comment out this test which means it will be ignored by Xamarin Test Cloud.  You comment out lines of code by add // marks before the lines of code.

```
//[Test]
//public void LaunchRepl()
//{
// app.Repl();
//}
```

GENERAL WORKFLOW:
When you use app.Repl() - the general workflow looks like this:
1) See what's on the screen by typing this command:

```
tree
```

2) Interact with what's on the screen with all the above commands you've learned.  For example - you might be on a login screen and you might type the following commands in REPL

```
app.Tap(x=>x.Marked("UserName");
app.EnterText("andrew");
app.DismissKeyboard();

app.Tap(x=>x.Marked("Password");
app.EnterText("myPassword");
app.DismissKeyboard();

app.Tap(x=>x.Marked("LoginButton"));
```

3) Next in the Repl you can type out the following word:

```
copy
```

And it will automatically copy the work that you've done.  You can now simply Paste these commands into Xamarin Studio / Visual Studio.  You may have to do some cleanup - but in general you should be good to go!  (Also sometime there will be an extra semi-colon at the end of your commands -- make sure you delete these one you're in Xamarin Studio / Visual Studio

Special note:
a) Suppose you are looking at two buttons on your screen.  You could simply app.Tap them but then if you choose the wrong one - it will actually tap the button and you'll move around the app.  Not a big deal but it can be cumbersome and take time moving from screen to screen.  In these situations - simply use the app.Flash command.  This will flash the relevant element on the screen - thereby letting you know if you've selected the correct element -- saving you the hassel of moving from screen to screen.

So to continue the same example above you would type:
app.Flash(x=>x.Marked("LoginButton") -- if you've got it right, then the Button will start flashing on the screen.
